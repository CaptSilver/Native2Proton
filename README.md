Force-download and run Windows versions of Steam Linux games using Proton

Native2Proton is a runner for forcing the install and execution of Windows versions of Steam games rather than running the native Linux version.

Depends on winetricks. Please ensure it is installed: '''sudo dpkg -s winetricks'''

To clone the repo: 

```git clone https://github.com/Holston5/Native2Proton.git && cd Native2Proton && chmod +x Native2Proton```

Run with `./Native2Proton`

The Steam ID for the game you wish to install is required.  It can be found in the url of the steam store page for the game.
